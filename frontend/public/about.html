        <div class="about__content">
            <p class="about__content-text">
                FinLite was born out of a deep understanding of the challenges faced by small business owners 
                in Africa. Our journey began when our founders, who have firsthand experience in the local 
                business landscape, recognized the need for a simple and effective financial management tool 
                tailored to the unique needs of everyday entrepreneurs. Frustrated by the complexity and 
                inaccessibility of existing solutions, they set out to create FinLite – a digital notebook that 
                prioritizes ease of use, practicality, and relevance.
            </p>
            <p>
                Through extensive research and collaboration with local business owners, we developed a platform 
                that reflects the realities of running a small business in Africa. Our team is passionate about 
                empowering entrepreneurs with the tools they need to succeed, and we are committed to continuously 
                improving our offerings based on user feedback and evolving market trends. Today, FinLite stands 
                as a testament to our dedication to supporting small businesses, helping them stay organized, 
                make informed decisions, and achieve their goals with confidence.
